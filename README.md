<h1>Hi there üëã</h1>

### ‚ú® Intro About Me 

üéì I'm currently a Computer Science student at the Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), working towards my Master's degree in Software Engineering. With more than a year and a half of commercial experience as a .NET Developer, my academic and professional focus revolves around crafting innovative software solutions. I specialize in developing Web Applications, particularly APIs that serve as the backbone of modern digital solutions.

üíª Experienced in backend development with a strong foundation in creating web applications and mastering the complexities of API development. Additionally, I possess knowledge of frontend development and have completed projects in this domain, showcasing a versatile skill set. Proficient in database design, establishing meaningful relationships between entities.

üèãÔ∏è When not immersed in code, you'll find me dedicated to personal well-being and fitness at the gym. I thoroughly enjoy creating delectable dishes, experimenting with flavors, and mastering the art of culinary craft in the cozy confines of my kitchen.

### üíº Commercial Experience

**Junior .NET Developer**

- Developed APIs for handling a telematics portal.
- Implemented automated tests to verify functionality and ensure reliability.
- Created functional and technical documentation for applications.
- Fixed bugs and optimized the backend layer for better performance.
- Designed and implemented a console application to automate testing of vehicle alert occurrences.
- Proposed and implemented a custom XSS defense filter, enhancing application security against cross-site scripting attacks.
- Developed a batch processing mechanism for defining alerts on vehicles.
- Refactored the data storage format for tire lcoation in alerts, transitioning from the ISO hex standard (e.g., 110, 310) to a more user-friendly representation (e.g., 1RI for 1st axle, right inner; 2LO for 2nd axle, left outer). Adapted the entire application to support the new format.
- Implemented a PUSH notification mechanism for alerts and portal messages, enabling instant notifications to drivers about critical events, such as wheel overheating (immediately visible on their registered devices, e.g., smartphones), or updates about messages received from other portal users. Additionally, apply mechanism for driver-trailer connection and disconnection events. Expanded the system so as users from external application can integrate to receive push notifications. 
- Developed an integration mechanism between systems for task creation and command storage related to the reconfiguration of wheel sensors.
- Developed a sender module for email and SMS communication in a remote inspection system, integrating event publishing and message preparation between two internal systems.
